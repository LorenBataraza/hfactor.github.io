- Stop aiming for an ideal, perfect design. We'll never get there.
- Instead of keeping 'perfect design' as the benchmark, compare with the **baseline** — the current reality and how much this change enhanced their experience. 
- Comparing with baseline and knowing that it's improving the product _for users_ will motivate the product team. It’s less about us and more about value for the customer.
- Scope grows naturally, like grass. It's not the fault of managers, programmers, or clients. More, we reach more profound; we see more micro details and potentials — not only blockers, but also potential improvements. 
- Making choices makes the product better, as long as it follows a direction. [[Software design should be opinionated]]. Always see features as must-haves and nice-to-haves, and [[Prioritize enablers and blockers]]
